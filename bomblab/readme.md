The general approach for this lab is: after obtaining the assembly code of the bomb, understand each phase, and then find the input that prevents the bomb from exploding.

Since we don’t have a cloud server for real-time evaluation, this lab cannot be tested, but solutions can be found all over the internet.

When I worked on this lab, I mainly relied on reading. If there’s a value or string in the assembly code that is unknown, you can use GDB to check it.

Here’s a summary of how to read assembly code:

- First, translate all the instructions, keeping the register names, and represent jumps with `goto`.
- Then, break it into parts and write it in a form similar to C++.

Don’t translate directly, as it’s likely to be confusing.
